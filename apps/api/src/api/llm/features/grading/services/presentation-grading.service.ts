    QUESTION:
    {question}
    
    ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
    {assignment_instructions}
    
    PREVIOUS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:
    {previous_questions_and_answers}
    
    PRESENTATION DATA:
    Transcript: {transcript}
    Content Report: {contentReport}
    Speech Report: {speechReport}
    Body Language Score: {bodyLanguageScore}
    Body Language Explanation: {bodyLanguageExplanation}
    
    SCORING INFORMATION:
    Total Points Available: {total_points}
    Scoring Type: {scoring_type}
    Scoring Criteria: {scoring_criteria}
    
    CRITICAL GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:
    You MUST grade according to the EXACT rubric provided in the scoring criteria. If the scoring type is "CRITERIA_BASED" with rubrics:
    1. Evaluate the presentation against EACH rubric question provided
    2. Award points based ONLY on the criteria descriptions provided for each rubric
    3. Do NOT use generic presentation criteria unless specifically mentioned in the rubric
    4. For each rubric, select the criterion that best matches the student's performance and award those exact points
    5. The total points awarded must equal the sum of points from all rubrics
    6. Use ALL available presentation data (transcript, speech report, body language) to evaluate each rubric
    
    GRADING APPROACH (AEEG):
    
    1. ANALYZE: Carefully examine the presentation data and describe what you observe
       - Review the transcript for content completeness and accuracy
       - Examine speech patterns, pacing, and vocal delivery from the speech report
       - Observe body language indicators and their impact on the presentation
       - Note the overall structure and flow of the presentation
       - Identify key points, examples, and arguments presented
       - Focus analysis on aspects relevant to the rubric criteria
    
    2. EVALUATE: For each rubric question in the scoring criteria:
       - Read the rubric question carefully
       - Use ALL presentation data (transcript, speech, body language) to assess performance
       - Compare the presentation against each criterion level
       - Select the criterion that best matches the student's performance
       - Award the exact points specified for that criterion
       - Do NOT average or adjust points - use the exact values provided
    
    3. EXPLAIN: Provide clear reasons for the grade based on specific observations from the presentation
       - Focus on what the learner DID or DID NOT demonstrate in their presentation
       - If criteria are fully met: Point out what was correctly demonstrated (e.g., "The transcript shows clear organization")
       - If criteria are partially met: State what was included AND what specific elements are missing
       - If criteria are NOT met: Explain what specific presentation elements are absent
       - Reference specific moments from the transcript and reports
       - Do NOT state criterion requirements or start with "Criterion requires..."
       - Focus on the presentation itself, not what the rubric asks for
       - Justify the total points as the sum of all rubric scores

    4. GUIDE: Offer concrete suggestions for improvement
       - Frame as actionable guidance: "The presentation should include..." or "Consider adding..."
       - Provide specific techniques based on what's missing (e.g., "Add more pauses between key points")
       - Suggest ways to improve speech patterns and vocal variety based on gaps identified
       - Recommend body language adjustments for better engagement
       - Offer strategies for better structure and organization
       - NO encouragement, NO praise - focus on concrete improvement steps
    
    GRADING INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Be fair, consistent, and constructive in your evaluation
    - Use ALL available data (transcript, speech, body language) in your assessment
    - Balance honesty about weaknesses with recognition of strengths
    - Ensure feedback is specific to the presentation data provided
    - Use encouraging language while maintaining academic standards
    
    Respond with a JSON object containing:
    - Points awarded (sum of all rubric scores)
    - Comprehensive feedback incorporating all four AEEG components
    - Separate fields for each AEEG component
    - If scoring type is CRITERIA_BASED, include rubricScores array with score for each rubric

    FEEDBACK APPROACH (AEEG):
    
    1. ANALYZE: Carefully examine the presentation data and describe what you observe
       - Study the transcript for main ideas and supporting details
       - Review speech characteristics (pace, tone, clarity, fluency)
       - Examine body language and its alignment with the message
       - Note engagement level and presentation confidence
       - Identify patterns in delivery and content organization
    
    2. EVALUATE: Assess the effectiveness of the presentation
       - Judge content relevance and depth based on the question
       - Evaluate speech quality and audience engagement potential
       - Assess non-verbal communication effectiveness
       - Consider overall coherence and persuasiveness
       - Measure achievement of presentation objectives
    
    3. EXPLAIN: Provide clear explanations of your assessment
       - Focus on what the learner DID or DID NOT demonstrate in their presentation
       - Reference specific examples from the transcript showing what was present or absent
       - Connect observations from speech and body language reports
       - Point out what was correctly demonstrated with evidence
       - Explain what specific elements are missing or need improvement
       - Do NOT state criterion requirements or start with "Criterion requires..."
       - Focus on the presentation itself, not what was expected

    4. GUIDE: Offer concrete suggestions for improvement
       - Frame as actionable guidance: "The presentation should include..." or "Consider adding..."
       - Recommend specific content enhancements based on what's missing
       - Suggest vocal technique improvements (e.g., "Vary your pace more", "Add pauses after key points")
       - Provide body language tips for better impact based on gaps identified
       - Offer strategies for better organization
       - NO encouragement, NO praise - focus on concrete improvement steps
    
    FEEDBACK INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Structure your feedback following the AEEG format
    - Be specific, actionable, and supportive
    - Balance constructive criticism with positive reinforcement
    - Focus on growth and improvement opportunities
    - Ensure all recommendations are practical and achievable
    
    Respond with a JSON object containing:
    - Comprehensive feedback incorporating all AEEG components
    - Separate fields for each AEEG component (analysis, evaluation, explanation, guidance)
