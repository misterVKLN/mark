# Mark Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Mark project for local development.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20.9.0
- Yarn 1.22.22
- Docker Desktop (for PostgreSQL database)

## Quick Start

To start the entire project in one command:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will automatically:

1. Install dependencies
2. Start the database
3. Run migrations
4. Seed the database
5. Start development servers

## Step-by-Step Setup

If you prefer to run each step individually, **follow this exact order**:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- Make sure you have Node.js >= 20.9.0 installed
- Ensure you're using Yarn 1.22.22

### 2. Start Database

```bash
yarn db
```

This will:

- Check if Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
- Start a PostgreSQL container using docker-compose
- Wait for the database to be ready
- Persist data in a Docker volume (survives container restarts)

**Database Management:**

```bash
# Stop database (keeps data)
docker-compose stop

# Stop and remove container (keeps data)
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove all data (fresh start)
docker-compose down -v

# View database logs
docker-compose logs -f postgres

# Restart database
docker-compose restart postgres
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you get "Docker is not installed", install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- If you get "Docker daemon is not running", start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully start
- If you get "docker-compose is not installed", Docker Compose comes with Docker Desktop (or install docker-compose-plugin on Linux)

### 3. Run Migrations

```bash
yarn setup
```

This will:

- Validate critical environment variables
- Run Prisma migrations
- Generate Prisma client

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you get "Dependencies not installed", run `yarn` first
- If you get "Database container is not running", run `yarn db` first
- If you get "Missing critical environment variables", check the error message for which variables are missing and add them to `dev.env`

### 4. Seed Database

```bash
yarn seed
```

This will seed the database with initial data. The script intelligently handles two scenarios:

- **If `seed.sql` exists in root**: Uses `pg_restore` to restore from the SQL dump
- **If no `seed.sql` found**: Uses TypeScript seed file to create sample data

**Important:** You must run `yarn setup` before `yarn seed` to ensure Prisma client is generated and migrations are applied.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you get "Prisma client not generated", run `yarn setup` first
- If you get "Database container is not running", run `yarn db` first
- If you get "node_modules not found", run `yarn` first

### 5. Start Development Servers

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will:

- Validate all requirements are met
- Start all development servers in parallel

**Troubleshooting:**

- Follow the error messages which will guide you through the required setup steps

## Environment Variables

### Critical Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required and validated before starting the application:

- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - Database password
- `POSTGRES_USER` - Database user
- `POSTGRES_DB` - Database name
- `POSTGRES_HOST` - Database host
- `POSTGRES_PORT` - Database port (internal, 5432)
- `POSTGRES_EXTERNAL_PORT` - External port for Docker (6001)
- `API_PORT` - API server port
- `API_GATEWAY_PORT` - API Gateway port
- `API_GATEWAY_HOST` - API Gateway host
- `PORT` - Frontend port

These are defined in `dev.env` in the project root.

**Note**: `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_URL_DIRECT` are automatically constructed from the Postgres variables if not explicitly set.

### Validation

To manually validate your environment variables:

```bash
./scripts/validate-env.sh
```

## Development Workflow

### Normal Development

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Resetting Database

To reset the database with fresh data:

```bash
# Option 1: Keep container, re-run migrations and seed
yarn setup
yarn seed

# Option 2: Complete fresh start (removes all data)
docker-compose down -v
yarn db
yarn setup
yarn seed
```

### Viewing Database

```bash
yarn studio
```

This opens Prisma Studio to view and edit database records.

## Testing

To run end-to-end tests with Playwright:

```bash
# First time: install Playwright browsers
yarn playwright:install

# Prepare setup state using the Playwright setup project
yarn test:setup

# Local default: Chromium author + learner projects
yarn test:e2e

# Full browser matrix
yarn test:e2e:all

# Role-specific full-matrix runs
yarn playwright:learner
yarn playwright:author
```

**Note**: `yarn playwright:install` downloads browser binaries (~300MB). This is separate from `yarn install` and only needs to be run once.

For detailed testing documentation including:

- Test architecture and authentication
- Writing and recording tests
- Troubleshooting test failures
- CI/CD integration

See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Docker is not installed or not in PATH"

**Solution:** Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

### "Docker daemon is not running"

**Solution:** Start Docker Desktop and wait for it to fully start

### "Dependencies not installed"

**Solution:** Run `yarn` to install dependencies

### "Database container is not running"

**Solution:** Run `yarn db` to start the database

### "Prisma client not generated"

**Solution:** Run `yarn setup` to generate the Prisma client

### "Missing critical environment variables"

**Solution:**

1. Check the error message for which variables are missing
2. Open `dev.env` in your editor
3. Add the missing variables (refer to the error message for required variables)

### "Port is already in use"

**Problem:** Development or database port is occupied by another process

**Solution:**

1. Check which process is using the port (shown in the error message)
2. Stop that process
3. Or change the port in `dev.env`:
   - `POSTGRES_EXTERNAL_PORT` for database (default: 6001)
   - `PORT` for frontend (default: 3010)
   - `API_PORT` for API (default: 4222)
   - `API_GATEWAY_PORT` for API Gateway (default: 8000)

To kill a process using a specific port:

```bash
# Replace PORT_NUMBER with the actual port
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:PORT_NUMBER)
```

## Additional Scripts
